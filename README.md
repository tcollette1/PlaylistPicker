# PlaylistPicker
A simple internet radio automation application for scheduling playlists and station IDs, built on Mac Catalyst and the Music app. I created PlaylistPicker from an iOS app called Radio Run I designed to work on an iPhone or iPad. Since handheld device apps sleep when unattended, the playlist scheduling required human assistance to work properly, so I ported Radio Run to work exclusively for Mac Catalyst. To run PlaylistPicker as intended, there are several requirements:
1) A fairly large music collection. To run mine 24/7, I created 7 playlists with 200 to 600 songs each. Most of them run every day, some on weekends.
2) A few dozen audio files that serve as your station IDs. These are 5-15 seconds long in my system.
